            "Booklet with pale brown cover and brown insignia 'HEKOFA' and titled: 'Private Konditoren-Fachschule A. Heckmann Koln/Rhein'. 20 pages. This booklet belonging to Karl Muffler documents 'Special Recipes' of the Konditoren-Fachschule A. Heckmann Koln/Rhein', 1913. It would have formed part of his accumulated tools of trade. Karl Muffler brought this recipe book with him when he migrated to Australia in 1930. <br/><br/>This item relates to Karl Friedrich Muffler, qualified pastry chef and confectioner, born in 1900, who migrated to Melbourne from Germany in 1930, aboard the passenger liner 'Balranald'. Muffler quickly established himself in Melbourne, commencing employment with Bill Ikinger (who had recruited and sponsored him) at his cake shop in Brunswick, as well as joining the long-running German establishment 'Club Tivoli'. Muffler went on to establish his own business, 'The Embassy' in Malvern, and in 1939 married fellow German migrant Mathilde 'Hilde' Mayer. At this time they were members of the 'German Labour Front' of which Adolf Mayer (Hilde's father) was president. On 4th September, 1939 Karl Muffler, along with dozens of other German residents (including his father-in-law), was placed into police custody as an enemy alien. He was transferred to Tatura internment camp in northern Victoria and while there undertook woodcarving and drafting classes and worked as a cake decorator. He was transferred to a Forestry Commission camp in Broadford, and finally released in 1945. With no family left in Germany he decided to stay in Australia and became naturalised in 1947. He and Hilde had two daughters. After the war, Muffler accepted a position at William Angliss Food Trades School in Melbourne teaching ex-servicemen new skills in cake decoration. He also worked at Paterson's cake shop in Windsor until well into the 1970s. He maintained a connection to the German community though Club Tivoli and died in 1996.

            "Hard red cloth covered folder with decorated cover in black and title 'Gesellen-Prufungs-Zeugnis'. Inside inscriptions in red with sections completed in black. Chamber of Trade certification for the profession of 'Konditor' (confectioner) dated 1917 in Freiburg, Germany for Karl Muffler. Karl Muffler brought the certificate with him, along with a number of other qualfications documents and professional references, when he migrated to Australia in 1930 in order to practise as a pastry confectioner.<br/><br/>This item relates to Karl Friedrich Muffler, qualified pastry chef and confectioner, born in 1900, who migrated to Melbourne from Germany in 1930, aboard the passenger liner 'Balranald'. Muffler quickly established himself in Melbourne, commencing employment with Bill Ikinger (who had recruited and sponsored him) at his cake shop in Brunswick, as well as joining the long-running German establishment 'Club Tivoli'. Muffler went on to establish his own business, 'The Embassy' in Malvern, and in 1939 married fellow German migrant Mathilde 'Hilde' Mayer. At this time they were members of the 'German Labour Front' of which Adolf Mayer (Hilde's father) was president. On 4th September, 1939 Karl Muffler, along with dozens of other German residents (including his father-in-law), was placed into police custody as an enemy alien. He was transferred to Tatura internment camp and while there undertook woodcarving and drafting classes and worked as a cake decorator. He was transferred to a Forestry Commission camp in Broadford, and finally released in 1945. With no family left in Germany he decided to stay in Australia and became naturalised in 1947. After the war, Muffler accepted a position at William Angliss Food Trades School in Melbourne teaching ex-servicemen new skills in cake decoration. He maintained a connection to the German community though Club Tivoli and died in 1996. Inscriptions: Text, front cover: Gesellen-/Prufungs - Zeugnis. "

            "2.61KW (3.5H.P.) ENGINE NO. 16316. The Triumph company was one of the most successful of the early British motorcycle manufacturers. The firm was established in 1897 by two Germans, Siegfried Bettmann and Maurice Schulte. Originally a bicycle manufacturer, the first Triumph motorcycle emerged in 1902 with a Minerva 220 c.c engine. Engines were also sourced from JAP and Fafnir before the first factory single-cylinder engine was designed by Schulte in 1906. This was a 3.5 horsepower single-cylinder unit. It was used on several models over the next decade.<br/><br/>The Museum's engine is serial number 16316 and was built in 1911 at the Triumph works in Coventry. It was purchased at auction by the Museum in 1972. A letter from the Triumph Engineering Company Limited in October 1972 confirmed the date of manufacture but all records relating to the early history of the company were lost in a German air raid on Coventry in 1940 which destroyed the original factory..

            "Never before in the world's history have two million troops, with supplies, munitions and equipment, been sent over so many miles of open sea with so few losses. When America entered the great World War, one of our great problems—probably the greatest next to raising and training a huge army—was how to get them \"over there.\" Indeed, the German people were made to believe by their government that even if the United States could raise and train a large army, it could not be transported across the Atlantic in time to win the war. The high efficiency of the British and American navies, and the wonderful cooperation between them, solved the problem of protecting the transports from the German U-boats. But vessels were badly needed for use as transports, and these transports had to be provided without interfering with the shipment of supplies, munitions, and equipment. Then, upon our entry into the war, our Government took over 109 German ships, which had been interned in American ports. In spite of the fact that their German crews had attempted to damage these ships so that they would be useless, American ingenuity had soon repaired the damage, and thousands of our boys went to defeat the Hun in these German-made vessels. Our boys were brought home in record breaking time, and with the German navy surrendered and the German U-boat swept off the sea, many of our finest battleships did \"their bit\" as transports. The Louisiana, shown in our picture, was engaged in this service. "

            "Among the many terrible things used for the first time in the great World War, the airplanes and submarines attracted the most notice. On February 4, 1915, the German government proclaimed a war zone about the British Isles and declared its intention of sinking without warning any enemy merchant ships found within this zone. On May 1, 1915, the Lusitania was sunk. On February 1, 1917, Germany began her \"ruthless submarine warfare\". Immediately, friendly relations were broken off and on April 6, 1917, the United States declared war. At first it seemed as if the Germans would win. Then it was found that the submarines could be seen from airplanes directly above ; also very swift tropedo boats, destroyers, were able to drive them away. As a matter of fact, not one U. S. transport was lost on its way to Europe, and but three on the way home. The submarine is the weakest, most helpless of fighting craft. It cannot fight under the rules of warfare laid down by international law. Its only safety lies in swiftness and surprise, All the great nations now have submarines. They are here to stay. A submarine may travel on the surface or under the water. It has a system of engines for surface running and for charging storage batteries. These storage batteries are the motive power when submerged. Notice the tall periscopes. In each one is a vertical system of lenses and prisms by which the observer down below is able to see on every side. There is also a sound detector which indicates the approach and motion of a ship.
