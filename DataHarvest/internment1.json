The wheels are shod with 1 5/8 inch (4.1 cm) solid rubber tyres. The water-cooled, horizontally-opposed twin cylinder engine, with trembler coil ignition and side draught carburettor, was made by the International Harvester Co. The engine is mounted on the left side of the car, and a large flywheel is keyed and clamped by a bolt to the crankshaft on its right side. The drive is taken from the 2-speed epicyclic gearbox by roller chain to the countershaft. A separate chain then takes the drive to each rear wheel. The wagon features a right-hand steering wheel which is not thought to be original. The footbrake operates on the differential and is of the external contracting type, and there is an emergency hand brake. The gear/clutch lever is located on the driver's right, the spark and throttle lever below the steering wheel, and the brake pedal beneath the right foot. Suspension is via elliptic springs front and rear with a transverse leaf spring under the load tray. Instruments include a speedometer/odometer driven from a front wheel. The body is finished in a light stone colour with black trim. Two to three passengers were carried on a single bench seat. The \"IHC\" monogram is attached to the radiator of the small dummy bonnet, which is in fact a water tank. The wagon is fitted with lamps powered by an acetylene gas cylinder on the offside running board. The two headlights feature mirrored glass concave reflecting plates with 155 mm (6 inch) thick glass and were made by the Indiana Lamp Co., Connersville, Indiana.\n\nSpecifications\n\nEngine: 2 cylinder \nCapacity: 3218 cc\nRating: 20 horsepower\nClutch: band type, dry\nGearbox: 2 forward, 1 reverse\nWheelbase: 93 inches (2.4 m) \nTrack: 64 inches (1.6 m) \nTransmission: chain drive to rear wheels\nAll up weight: 30 cwt (1,524 kg) \nTop speed: 20 mph (32.2 kph) (unladen)\nCruising speed: 15 mph (24.1 kph) (unladen) "

        "description": [
            "By 1915, the International Harvester Company (IHC) was the world's leading tractor manufacturer with successful designs such as the Mogul 12-25 and 8-16 capturing a third of U.S tractor sales. IHC also owned the McCormick & Deering brands which gave the company enormous market power which was challenged in Australia by H.V McKay who launched a relentless and successful campaign to introduce federal tariff protection for local agricultural machinery makers. In response, IHC established a local organisation in 1912; International Harvester Australia Pty Ltd (IHA) allowed the firm to assemble equipment from imported components in Australia.<br/><br/>Introduced in 1915, the Titan 10-20 model built on the experience of earlier successful IHC tractors, with a total of nearly 80,000 10-20s manufactured at the IHC plant at Milwaukee, Wisconsin, USA. The 10-20 was the smallest model produced by IHC with a total weight of 2,372 kgs (5,225 lbs). The engine was a kerosene-fuelled, two-cylinder horizontal unit producing around 14.8 kW (20 h.p.) at the belt with a two-speed gearbox. The large front-mounted 117 litre tank held water was for engine cooling which circulated water via simple temperature differential thus avoiding the use of a water pump or radiator fan assembly. The Titan 10-20 was imported into Australia by IHA. In common with many early tractors the design is crude with a steel girder frame and twin chain & sprocket drive to the rear wheels.<br/><br/>This Titan 10-20 tractor was used on the 'Green Mountains' poultry farm in Croydon from the early 1950s until its donation in 1964.  The Titan tractor was used to plough the paddock in which feed for the chickens was grown.  It was acquired in poor condition in 1964 and was subsequently restored cosmetically by Vivian Expositions for display. "

The wheels are shod with 1 5/8 inch (4.1 cm) solid rubber tyres. The engine, made by the International Harvester Co., is an air-cooled, four-cycle, two-cylinder horizontally-opposed type, with trembler coil ignition and side draught Schebler carburettor. The engine is mounted on the left side of the car and a large flywheel is keyed and clamped by a bolt to the crankshaft on its right side. Two fans, one for each cylinder, are driven by a flat belt. A starting handle projects from the left side of the car and is connected by reduction gearing and a ratchet. The running board is hinged to allow access to the handle. The external pressure lubrication is achieved with a Type H oil pump by the Precision Appliance Co., No. 4659, patented in November 1908 in Chicago, USA. The automatic oiler operates ten small plunger pumps supplying oil to the engine bearings, cylinder walls, cooling fan spindles and transmission gear. The magneto is the Star brand K, No. 1368 made by the Hercules Electric Co., of Indiana, Ohio. The drive is taken from the 2-speed epicyclic gearbox by roller chain to the countershaft. A separate chain then takes the drive to each rear wheel. The car has a right-hand steering wheel (whereas other Auto Buggies of the period had tiller steering). The footbrake operates on the differential and is of the external contracting type. The hand brake operates on the rear wheels and is of the internal expanding type. The gear/clutch lever is located on the driver's right, the spark and throttle lever below the steering wheel, and the brake pedal beneath the right foot. Instruments include a speedometer/odometer, driven from the front wheel (model No. 23 made by Stewart & Clark Mfg Co. of Chicago, USA). The body is finished in green with red trim, the wheels are maroon with black trim, the front and rear mudguards are black, and the folding hood is of 10 ounce (283.5 gram) black canvas. Four to six passengers were carried on two leather upholstered and heavily-buttoned bench seats.

Black & white cellulose acetate photographic negative. Part of a large collection of glass plate and film negatives, transparencies, photo albums, product catalogues, videos, motion picture films, company journals, advertisements and newspaper cuttings relating to the operations of the International Harvester Company and its subsidiaries in Australia.<br/><br/>The International Harvester Company of America was formed in 1902 by the merger of five leading American agricultural machinery manufacturers. An Australian subsidiary was established in 1904 to manage Australian distribution and sales and over subsequent decades International Harvester became a major competitor to local manufacturers like H.V. McKay's Sunshine Harvester Works. <br/><br/>Later International Harvester established its own Australian manufacturing works, producing agricultural equipment (and later tractors) at Geelong from 1939, motor trucks at Dandenong from 1952 and earthmoving and construction equipment at Port Melbourne from 1958.

            "Collection of silver albumen photographs, most loose, contained in a 'post card album'. Believed to have been taken (or collected in some cases) by F.C. Krichauff, who worked as a photographer in South Australia. The son of Friedrich E. H. W. Krichauff (1824-1904), Frederick Charles Krichauff married Elizabeth Alcie Gemmell in 1898. In addition to his photography, Krichauff was an architect (he designed the Hazelwood Park rotunda) and a member of the Royal Philatelic Society. He lived in Portrush Road, Toorak Gardens in the later part of his life and died in 1954 aged 92. This is one of three albums - see also B 71095 and B 71096. The following images have not been digitised: Image 32 is a duplicate of B 71094/31, and image 30 is a duplicate of B 71094/29. Items 35-44 inclusive are postcards with non- South Australian content - details are: 35. A high domed rotunda, possibly St Paul{7f2019}s, London, behind a building with columns, high arched balconies and fancy decorations over the entrance, possibly 1882 when F.E.H.W. Krichauff went overseas; 36. A tall ornate incomplete Cathedral, grave stones labelled 1823 and 1869 including one inscription {212040}Maria wife of George Thomas Wood died 1869; 37. A Cathedral under construction, in place unknown, a man leaning against a fountain, a horse and cart, possibly 1882; 38. St Paul{7f2019}s Cathedral, London, ca.1882; 39. West front of Westminster Abbey, London, ca.1882; 40. St. Mungo{7f2019}s, Glasgow, with street lamps and horse drawn vehicles, ca.1882 ; 41. Houses of Parliament from Lambeth Bridge, ca.1882; Incendie Halles d'Ypres, 22 November 1914 - in the foreground it is labelled in black ink writing as 'Cloth Hall in the course of destruction'; 43. A church, possibly in Europe, and a four storey crucifix above three grottos with religious statues.ca.1882; 44. 'Florinde {7f2013} Winterhalter', ca.1882.

The engine is mounted on a transport with cast-iron chassis or bedplate and cast-iron wheels. It has a single straight-spoked flywheel. The engine is unrestored and appears to be essentially complete, with the exception of the cooling tank and still has original paintwork, though it is faded.

The firm was established in 1897 by two Germans, Siegfried Bettmann and Maurice Schulte. Originally a bicycle manufacturer, the first Triumph motorcycle emerged in 1902 with a Minerva 220 c.c engine. Engines were also sourced from JAP and Fafnir before the first factory single-cylinder engine was designed by Schulte in 1906. This was a 3.5 horsepower single-cylinder unit. It was used on several models over the next decade.<br/><br/>The Museum's engine is serial number 16316 and was built in 1911 at the Triumph works in Coventry. It was purchased at auction by the Museum in 1972. A letter from the Triumph Engineering Company Limited in October 1972 confirmed the date of manufacture but all records relating to the early history of the company were lost in a German air raid on Coventry in 1940 which destroyed the original factory..

        "description": [
            "The Gnome rotary aero engine was made by the Societe Des Moteurs Gnome & Rhone in Paris. It was the most successful early aero engine design. The journal 'Flight' stated in its 31 December 1910 edition that \"...it not only worked satisfactorily but was at one time practically the only motor capable of developing the necessary power within the necessary limits of weight\".The rotary engine operated on the principle of a fixed crankshaft with the cylinders revolving at high speed. Gnome & Le Rhone engines were developed to include an 80 horsepower (9-cylinder), 100 horsepower, (14-cylinder) and a 160 horsepower models. Gnome engines were built under licence in Britain, Italy and the United States. Various models of the Gnome rotary were fitted to types including the Avro 504 trainer, the Sopwith Pup and the French Nieuport 28C.1 fighter aircraft. Rotary engines had a good power-to-weight ratio but there were limitations to their development as increasing gyroscopic forces in the direction of the spinning cylinders caused handling problems. The oil system was a 'total loss' principle which sprayed castor oil not only on the engine but also over the pilot if the engine was mounted at the front. There was no throttle control with engine speed regulated by a 'blip switch' operated by the pilot which could cut the ignition temporarily. By 1918 the rotary was considered obsolete for military aviation.<br/><br/>This 50 horsepower, 7-cylinder Gnome engine, serial no. (1743)4937 was purchased by the Museum at an auction of six surplus aircraft and five aero engines plus spare parts held at Point Cook, Victoria on 19 March 1919 by Charles Forrester & Co. on behalf of the Defence Department. The purchase price was 40 Pounds for the only Gnome engine sold on the day. A note on file states that this engine had been imported some five years previously which would indicate it was part of the original batch of equipment purchased for the Australian Flying Corps at the time the Central Flying School (CFS), Point Cook was established in 1914. The British & Colonial Aeroplane Co. (Bristol) were the British empire agent for Gnome engines. This type of 50 horsepower, seven-cylinder Gnome Omega rotary engine was installed in the Bristol Boxkite aircraft used at the School for flying training. In 1915 a spare 50 horsepower Gnome engine was also fitted to Boxkite CFS.8 manufactured at Point Cook, the first military aircraft to be built in Australia. The Gnome engine was also used for ground instruction of trainee mechanics at CFS. Following acquisition by the Museum this engine was sectioned to show the internal parts. "

            "BSA Model K three-speed belt-drive motorcycle with vertical single-cylinder side-valve engine, manufacture in 1916. The Victoria agent for BSA motor cycles was Milledge Bros from 1912 to 1918. After 1918 the agent was Finlay Bros. The Model K was one of BSA's main pre World War I models, popular with both solo and sidecar riders throughiout Britain and British colonial markets. Civilan supply of BSA motorcycles ceased in 1916 due to wartime demands for military production by the British Government, with BSA concentrating for a period largely on small arms manufacure. Production of the Model K motor cycles resumed after the War and continued into the 1920s.<br/><br/>The BSA brandname was derived from the Birmingham Small Arms Company founded in June 1861 in Birmingham, England, by a collective of independent gunsmiths from the Birmingham Small Arms Trade Association. After transforming Birmingham's small arms industry through the introduction of mechanised mass production and standardised components, BSA later diversified it's manufacturing interested, producing bicycles and cycle components from 1869, motor cars from 1908 and motorcycles from 1910. After the First World War, BSA Cycles Ltd was set up as a subsidiary company in 1919, to manufacture both bicycles and motorcycles. BSA motorcycles were sold as affordable machines with reasonable performance for the average private or commercial user. BSA stressed the reliability of their machines and the availability of spares and dealer support. Their designs used a mixture of single and twin-cylinder sidevalve (SV) and overhead-valve (OHV) engines offering different performance for various roles.<br/><br/>This BSA Model K machine was initially loaned to the Museum by Mr Alexander E. Copland and was formally donated to the Museum by the Estate of Alexander Ewart Copland in 2006. It carries a South Australian registration label and the registration number 7147. The registration tag expired on 31 March 1945. Copland was a noted collector of antiques and automotive items over many decades. "

It is thought to be a 1911 model car and was sourced second-hand in Ballarat by Tarrant Motors who then sectioned the major components for the Museum. A similar 'split' chassis unit was exhibited by Tarrants at the 1912 Victorian Motor Exhibition at the Royal Exhibition Building with the working parts turned over by an electric motor. This exhibit is likely to have provided the idea for the acquisition of a sectioned chassis for display by the Museum.<br/><br/>This unit represents the form in which many motor cars were imported. Lower import tariffs were charged on cars without bodies to protect the local motor body-building industry. Bodies were made by local firms such as Tarrants who operated several assembly and body-building works in Melbourne devoted to Model T vehicles as well as other makes such as Fiat and BSA. Chassis and engines units for Ford cars were imported from Ford's factory in Ontario, Canada to take advantage of lower tariffs on goods of British Empire origin. According to advertising by Tarrant Motors, Ford Model T cars were usually imported in shipments of about sixty chassis units and an October 1910 advertisement stated that \"they sell as fast as we can land them\".

        "description": [
            "This four-cylinder, horizontally-opposed engine is one of the earliest aero engines to be built in Australia. It was designed and built by two young motor mechanics, Azor D. Robbins and Aubrey Keith Lock. Robbins was employed at Dalgetys Garage in Bourke Street, Melbourne while Lock was an apprentice with Herbert Thomson's Steam Car Company in Armadale. They had been approached to build a 50 horsepower (37 kW) aero engine by Lawrence Marshall, a Melbourne inventor who was building a biplane to compete for a Commonwealth government prize of £5,000 for a military aeroplane. Lock and Robbins worked on the engine part-time in Richmond and subsequently at the Dalgety's engineering shop in Melbourne. A total of forty cylinders were believed to have been cast by an outside foundry from which the four best were selected. Despite this, the cylinders fractured during a bench test and Marshall refused to pay for the engine as it did not deliver the promised 50 horsepower.<br/><br/>It was later repaired by Lock and acquired by Azor Robbins and a business partner Alex Porter, who had built a Bleriot-type monoplane in Albury, New South Wales. Robbins and Porter had moved to Albury from Melbourne in 1911 opening their own automotive business at 532 Kiewa Street. The engine was reported to have been displayed at the 1912 Albury Show. Their aircraft is believed to have made several short flights in July 1913. The aircraft was subsequently sold to Blacklock's Garage in Dean Street Albury where it was later destroyed in a fire. The engine was salvaged by Aubrey Lock who kept it at his Melbourne house until his death in 1966. It was donated to the Museum, in pieces in 1978. Since then it has been reassembled and conserved to retain as much of the original finish and components as possible. The basic horizontally-opposed layout of this engine is still used by most light aircraft today. "

        "description": [
            "ABC Motors Ltd was formed in 1912 as the All British Engine Co. Ltd by Ronald Charteris with Granville Bradshaw as the chief designer. The company produced a range of radial air-cooled aero engines which was unusual at a time when many aero engines were rotary. The firm also produced a range of small stationary engines including the Firefly flat twin-cylinder engine sometimes used in British coastal patrol blimps to power radio sets. Early aero engines produced by the company were the 45 horsepower, twin cylinder Gnat, the 6-cylinder Mosquito, the 7-cylinder Wasp. The 9-cylinder 330 horsepower Dragonfly radial engine was intended to become the standard radial engine type fitted to British service aircraft from 1918 to replace the obsolete rotary engine. Two versions were built designated the Mark 1A and the Mark 2.<br/><br/>The Dragonfly was produced under licence by firms such as Guy Motors Ltd in Wolverhampton, the Sheffield-Simplex Motor Works Ltd at Tinsley, Sheffield and motorcycle manufacturer Clyno Engineering also in Wolverhampton. Sheffield-Simplex carried out design and development work on the engine. A total of about 11,000 were required. The end of the war in November 1918 and the discovery that the Dragonfly suffered from serious and irrepairable design faults such as overheating and vibration, led to cancellation of British Government production orders in 1919. Dragonfly engines were advertised for commercial sale from 1919 but they were not widely used. ABC went into partnership with the aircraft manufacturer Sopwith after World War I to manufacture motorcyles but this venture folded by 1922.<br/><br/>The Museum's ABC Dragonfly Mark 2 engine (no. 5059) was built by the Sheffield-Simplex Motor Works Ltd in 1918 was received on loan from the Science Museum in London in 1929 and subsequently donated in 1942. It was sectioned for display purposes. "

Its partly cast engine block is an interesting technological step to a fully-cast block introduced by Hispano-Suiza in 1916. <br/><br/>The Museum's Sturtevant V8 (construction No. 5052) is a Type 5, water-cooled engine delivering 140 horsepower. It was fitted to a Burgess Model 'O' pusher biplane made by the Burgess Co. at Marblehead in the USA. This aircraft had been designed following a visit by British government officials in 1915. The prototype is said to have flown just 21 days later. Some 36 Model 'O' aircraft were built but did not see active service with British forces. One example of the Burgess Model 'O' was purchased and imported into Australia by the industrialist Hugh Victor McKay of Melbourne. In 1917, McKay donated the Model 'O' biplane and engine no. 5052 to the Central Flying School (CFS) at Point Cook, Victoria, where they were used as ground training aids. <br/><br/>Following the First World War, this Sturtevant engine was purchased at auction by Mr Alan Hawker 'Bob' Chamberlain, a cousin of famous Australian aviator Harry Hawker. Bob Chamberlain fitted the Sturtevant to his 'Nautilis II' speedboat which is held in the collection of the Melbourne Maritime Museum. The Sturtevant engine was donated to Museum Victoria in 2005. "

            "Incomplete 2.9 litre, four cylinder engine, Model T engine Incomplete Model T engine, which was sourced by Tom Fraser of Vivian Expositions for display at the 1975 Melbourne International Motor Show, possibly to celebrate 50 years of Ford production in Australia. It was donated to the Museum in 1976.<br/><br/>This 2.9 litre, four cylinder engine was manufactured by the Ford Motor Company in Canada. Engine and chassis units were imported from Canada to take advantage of 'Imperial Preference' which allowed lower import duties for goods made in the British Empire and imported into Australia. This engine is serial no. 479040 indicating it was manufactured in about 1913-14. According to the local Ford agent, Tarrant Motors, Ford T Models were usually imported in shipments of about sixty chassis units. "
